When streaming audio to Gladia API, you can stream it either as binary frames or as JSON messages containing a base64-encoded chunk.

## Send audio chunks

There are two ways to stream audio:

1. As binary WebSocket frames:

```ts
// `buffer` is a Node.js Buffer / Uint8Array with raw audio bytes
socket.send(buffer);
```

2. As JSON, base64-encoding the audio chunk

```ts
socket.send(
	JSON.stringify({
		type: "audio_chunk",
		data: {
			chunk: buffer.toString("base64"),
		},
	})
);
```

## Tips

- Keep chunks reasonably sized (â‰ƒ 100ms) for low latency.
- Make sure your chunks are contiguous audio frames with the same format as configured during session initiation.
- On recoverable disconnects, reconnect using the same `url` to continue streaming.
