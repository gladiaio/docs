## General transcription flow

Getting your transcription using Gladia's API is pretty straight forward and can be splitted into 3 different steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload your file">
    <Note>This step is **optionnal** if you are already working with **audio URLs**. </Note>

    If you're working with audio or video files, you'll need to upload it first using our `/upload` endpoint with `multipart/form-data`
    content-type since Gladia `/v2/transcription` endpoint only accept audio URLs.

    If you are already using audio file URLs, proceed to the next step.

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/upload \
      --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
      --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_TOKEN' \
      --form audio=@/path/to/your/audio/conversation.wav
    ```
    
    Example response :

    ```json
    {
      "audio_url": "https://api.gladia.io/file/636c70f6-92c1-4026-a8b6-0dfe3ecf826f",
      "audio_metadata": {
        "id": "636c70f6-92c1-4026-a8b6-0dfe3ecf826f",
        "filename": "conversation.wav",
        "extension": "wav",
        "size": 99515383,
        "audio_duration": 4146.468542,
        "number_of_channels": 2
      }
    }
    ```

    We will now proceed to the next steps using the returned `audio_url`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transcribe">
    We'll now POST the transcription request to Gladia's API using the `/v2/transcription` endpoint.

    <Note> 
     `/v2/transcription` only accept `application/json` as Content-Type.
    </Note>

    ```bash cURL
      curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_TOKEN' \
        --data '{
        "audio_url": "YOUR_AUDIO_URL",
        "diarization": true,
        "diarization_config": {
          "number_of_speakers": 3,
          "min_speakers": 1,
          "max_speakers": 5
        },
        "translation": true,
        "translation_config": {
          "model": "base",
          "target_languages": ["fr", "en"]
        },
        "subtitles": true,
        "subtitles_config": {
          "formats": ["srt", "vtt"]
        },
        "detect_language": true,
        "enable_code_switching": false
        }
      '
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    You'll get an instant response from the request with and `id` and a `result_url`. The `id` is your transcription ID that you
    will use to get your transcription result once it's done.

    `result_url` is returned for convenience. This is a pre-built url with your transcription id in it that you can use to get your result in the next step.

  <Step title="Get the transcription result">
    <GetTranscriptionResult />
  </Step>
