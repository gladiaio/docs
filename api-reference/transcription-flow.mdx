## General flow

Getting your transcription using Gladia's API is pretty straight forward and can be splitted into 3 different steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload your file">
    <Note>This step is **optionnal** if you are already working with **audio URLs**. </Note>

    If you're working with audio files, you'll need to upload it first using our `/upload` endpoint with `multipart/form-data`
    content-type since Gladia `/v2/transcription` endpoint only accept audio URLs.

    If you are already using audio file URLs, proceed to the next step.

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/upload \
      --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
      --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_TOKEN' \
      --form audio=@/path/to/your/audio/conversation.wav
    ```
    
    Example response :

    ```json
    {
      "audio_url": "https://api.gladia.io/file/636c70f6-92c1-4026-a8b6-0dfe3ecf826f",
      "audio_metadata": {
        "id": "636c70f6-92c1-4026-a8b6-0dfe3ecf826f",
        "filename": "conversation.wav",
        "extension": "wav",
        "size": 99515383,
        "audio_duration": 4146.468542,
        "number_of_channels": 2
      }
    }
    ```

    We will now proceed to the next steps using the returned `audio_url`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transcribe">
    We'll now POST the transcription request to Gladia's API using the `/v2/transcription` endpoint.

    <Note> 
     `/v2/transcription` only accept `application/json` as Content-Type.
    </Note>

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash cURL
      curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_TOKEN' \
        --data '{
        "audio_url": "YOUR_AUDIO_URL",
        "diarization": true,
        "diarization_config": {
          "number_of_speakers": 3,
          "min_speakers": 1,
          "max_speakers": 5
        },
        "translation": true,
        "translation_config": {
          "model": "base",
          "target_languages": ["fr", "en"]
        },
        "subtitles": true,
        "subtitles_config": {
          "formats": ["srt", "vtt"]
        },
        "detect_language": true,
        "enable_code_switching": false
        }
      '
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    You'll get an instant response from the request with and `id` and a `result_url`. The `id` is your transcription ID that you
    will use to get your transcription result once it's done.

    `result_url` is returned for convenience. This is a pre-built url with your transcription id in it that you can use to get your result in the next step.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the transcription result">

  You can get your transcription results in 2 different ways: 

  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="repeat" title="Polling">

    Once you post your transcription request, you get a transcritpion `id` and a pre-built `result_url` for convenience.
    To get the result with this method, you'll just have to GET continuously on the given `result_url` until the status
    of your transcription is `done`.


    You can get more informations on the different transcriptions status by checking directly the [API Reference](/api-reference/)
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="diagram-project" title="Callback URL">

    Callback are HTTP calls that you can use to get notified when your transcripts are ready.

    Instead of polling and keeping your server busy and maintaning work, you can use the `callback_url` feature.
    By providing a `callback_url` on your transcription request body payload, we will send the results right there once 
    your transcription is done.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript TypeScript
    const requestData = {
      audio_url:
        "YOUR_AUDIO_URL",
      callback_url: 'https://yourserverurl.com/your/callback/endpoint/'
    };
    ```
    ```python Python
    request_data = {
      "audio_url": "YOUR_AUDIO_URL",
      "callback_url": 'https://yourserverurl.com/your/callback/endpoint/'
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Once the transcription is done, we'll make a `POST` request to the `callback_url` you provided with the results.
    The `POST` request body will be of shape:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "2aafc84e-e1c9-440c-bfda-2faa0f5d23b3", // Transcription ID
      "payload": { // Transcription result
        "metadata": {
          ...
        },
        "transcription": {
          "languages": [
            ...
          ],
          "full_transcript": "Split infinity in a time when less is more...",
          "utterances": [...],
          ...
        },
        ...
        }
      }
    ```

    If you get an error, instead of an `payload` property you'll get an `error` property of shape:

    ```json
    {
      "code": 415,
      "message": "no audio track is present"
    }
    ```
