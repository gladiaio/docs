<Tip>
  If you do not own a **Gladia API key** yet, get yours by following our [Account Setup guide](/chapters/get-started/pages/configure-account).
</Tip>

Once you got your API key, to authenticate, you just need to pass it in the header keys, like this:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription \
  --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY'
```

The header authentication method ensure that you are able to use Gladia in any environment or any cloud-based third party
 service.

This is the **only** authentication method you'll need to use all the API endpoints.


Next, we'll see what's the general transcription flow and how to manage it on your side.
