## Authenticate your API calls

Once you got your API key, pass it in the header `x-gladia-key`, like this:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription \
  --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY'
```

The header authentication method ensure that you are able to use Gladia in any environment or any cloud-based third party
 service.

This is the **only** authentication method you'll need to use all the API endpoints.

Next, we'll see what's the general pre-recorded flow and how to manage it on your side.
