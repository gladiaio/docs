This feature is in **Alpha** state.

We're looking for feedback to improve this feature, [share yours on Discord](https://discord.gg/T22a4ETUQp).
</Note>

The **Audio to LLM** feature applies your own prompts to the audio transcription. For now, it is only available for **pre-recorded** audio.

## Usage
Enable Audio to LLM by setting the appropriate flag and providing your prompts:

<CodeGroup>
```json Pre-recorded
{
  "audio_to_llm": true,
  "audio_to_llm_config": {
    "prompts": [
      "Extract the key points from the transcription as bullet points",
      "Generate a title from this transcription"
    ]
  }
}
```

```json Real-time
// Not available for real-time
```
</CodeGroup>

With this code, your output will look like this:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "is_empty": false,
  "results": [
    {
      "success": true,
      "is_empty": false,
      "results": {
        "prompt": "Extract the key points from the transcription as bullet points",
        "response": "The main entities key points from the transcription are:\n- ..."
      },
      "exec_time": 1.7726809978485107,
      "error": null
    },
    {
      "success": true,
      "is_empty": false,
      "results": {
        "prompt": "Generate a title from this transcription",
        "response": "The Great Title"
      },
      "exec_time": 1.7832809978258485,
      "error": null
    }
  ],
  "exec_time": 6.127103805541992,
  "error": null
}
```

You'll find the results for each prompt under the `results` key.
