The chapterization model segments the audio into logical chapters based on both audio cues and content, making it easier to navigate long recordings, such as meetings.
Each chapter includes its start and end time, a summary, a headline, a bottom-line “gist,” and relevant keywords.

## Configuration

Enable chapterization by setting ```chapterization``` to true in your transcription request. API reference is available [here](https://docs.gladia.io/api-reference/v2/pre-recorded/init#body-chapterization).

```json
{
  "audio_url": "<your audio URL>"
  "chapterization": true
}
```

## Results

The transcription result will contain a ```chapterization``` key with the output of the model.

```json
{
  "transcription":{...}
  "chapterization": {
    "success": true,
    "is_empty": false,
    "results": [
      {
        "summary": "In a world where minimalism is valued, yet excess is desired, hope for the future remains. The past predicts the present, which is yet to be determined.",
        "headline": "Headline: \"Embracing Hope: The Interconnectedness of Past, Present, and Future\"",
        "gist": "Embracing Hope: Past, Present, Future Interconnected",
        "keywords": [
          "Split infinity",
          "less is more",
          "too much",
          "hope",
          "present"
        ],
        "start": 0.0,
