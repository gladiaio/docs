description: 'The Chapterization model segments the audio into distinct chapters, each with a descriptive headline and summaries'
---

The chapterization model segments the audio 
into logical chapters based on the audio and content, and makes it easier to navigate long audios such as meeting recordings.

Each chapter will contain it's start and end time, as well as a summary, headline and bottom line "gist".

## Usage
Enable chapterization by simply setting ```chapterization``` to ```true``` in your transcription request.
```json
{
  "audio_url": "<your audio URL>"
  "chapterization": true
}
```
## Result
The transcription result will contain a ```"chapterization"``` key with the output of the model:

```json
{
  "transcription":{...}
  "chapterization": {
    "success": true,
    "is_empty": false,
    "chapters": [
          {
            "summary": "In a world where minimalism is valued, yet excess is desired, hope for the future remains. The past predicts the present, which is yet to be determined.",
            "headline": "Headline: \"Embracing Hope: The Interconnectedness of Past, Present, and Future\"",
            "gist": "Embracing Hope: Past, Present, Future Interconnected",
            "keywords": [
              "Split infinity",
