# Speaker Reidentification (Alpha)


<Note>
This feature is on **Alpha** state.

We're looking for feedbacks to improve this feature, [share yours here](https://gladiaio.typeform.com/feedback?typeform-source=app.gladia.io).

</Note>

Speaker reidentification allows you to track and identify speakers across multiple audio files by maintaining a database of speaker voice signatures. This feature is particularly useful for organizations that need to analyze conversations from multiple recordings while maintaining speaker consistency.

## Overview

When speaker reidentification is enabled, the system will:
1. Extract voice signatures from speakers in the audio
2. Compare these signatures with previously stored speakers
3. Assign consistent identifiers to matching speakers
4. Optionally save new speaker signatures for future identification

## Configuration

To enable speaker reidentification, set `speaker_reidentification` to `true` in your API request and provide the configuration through `speaker_reidentification_config`:

```json
{
  "speaker_reidentification": true,
  "speaker_reidentification_config": {
    "filters": {
      "customer_id": "123",
      "company": "gladia",
      "department": "tech"
    },
    "save_new_speakers": true,
    "save_new_speaker_similarity_threshold": 0.95,
    "boost_uuids": []
  }
}
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `speaker_reidentification` | boolean | Enable/disable speaker reidentification |
| `speaker_reidentification_config` | object | Configuration object for speaker reidentification |

### Speaker Reidentification Config Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `filters` | object | Filters to scope the speaker database search |
| `filters.customer_id` | string | Example of parameter called "customer_id" for scoping speaker search to a specific customer |
| `filters.company` | string | Example of parameter called "company" or Company name for scoping speaker search to a specific company that might be customer of your organization |
| `filters.department` | string | Example of parameter called "department" or Department name for further scoping to a specific department within a company that might be customer of your organization |
| `filters.whatever` | string | Example of parameter for further whatever scoping you need |
| `save_new_speakers` | boolean | Whether to save new speaker signatures to the database |
| `save_new_speaker_similarity_threshold` | float | Minimum similarity threshold (0-1) for saving new speakers (if we don't find a match withing this threshold) |
| `boost_uuids` | array | List of speaker UUIDs to prioritize in matching |

## Example Usage
We recommand activating the diarization and speaker reidentification features at the same time if you plan to identify mutliple speakers within the same audio.
Here's a complete example of using speaker reidentification with the API:

```json
{
  "sentences": false,
  "diarization": true,
  "speaker_reidentification": true,
  "speaker_reidentification_config": {
    "filters": {},
    "save_new_speakers": true,
    "save_new_speaker_similarity_threshold": 0.95,
    "boost_uuids": []
  },
  "audio_url": "https://files.gladia.io/example/audio-transcription/split_infinity.wav"
}
```

### Example Output for a Known Speaker
```json
"speaker_reidentification": {
  "success": true,
  "is_empty": false,
  "results": {
    "0": [
      {
        "score": 1.0000001,
        "created_at_timestamp": 1736419219.108255,
        "updated_at_timestamp": null,
        "created_at_iso": "2025-01-09T10:40:19.108256",
        "updated_at_iso": null,
        "last_accessed_timestamp": 1736419347.55111,
        "last_accessed_iso": "2025-01-09T10:42:27.551116",
        "is_new_speaker": false,
        "uuid": "fc04030f-5ad4-46f6-b9a0-8c238675165f",
        "filters": {}
      }
      // More matched speakers...
    ]
  }
}
```

### Example Output for an Unknown Speaker newly enrolled
```json
"speaker_reidentification": {
  "success": true,
  "is_empty": false,
  "results": {
    "6": [
      {
        "score": 1.0000001,
        "created_at_timestamp": 1736419302.801952,
        "updated_at_timestamp": null,
        "created_at_iso": "2025-01-09T10:41:42.801953",
        "updated_at_iso": null,
        "last_accessed_timestamp": 1736419500.189427,
        "last_accessed_iso": "2025-01-09T10:45:00.189431",
        "is_new_speaker": true,  # true if the speaker is not found in the database but has been enrolled
        "uuid": "c24c1436-6139-46f9-bcd8-4d633889661a",
        "filters": {}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always enable `diarization` when using speaker reidentification unless you have a specific reason not to (for instance speaker voiceprint registration)
2. Use appropriate filters to narrow down the speaker database search scope
3. Set a high `save_new_speaker_similarity_threshold` (e.g., 0.95) to ensure quality matches
4. Use `boost_uuids` when you want to prioritize matching with specific known speakers

## Limitations

- Speaker reidentification requires good quality audio for accurate matching
- Performance may vary based on audio quality and background noise
- The feature works best with clear speech and minimal overlapping voices
