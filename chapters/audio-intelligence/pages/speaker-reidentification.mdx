Speaker reidentification enables tracking and identifying speakers across multiple audio files by maintaining a database of speaker voice signatures. This feature is especially valuable for organizations analyzing conversations from different recordings while ensuring speaker consistency.

When speaker reidentification is enabled, the system will:
1. Extract voice signatures from speakers in the audio
2. Compare these signatures with previously stored speakers
3. Assign consistent identifiers to matching speakers
4. Optionally save new speaker signatures for future identification

### Configuration

Enable speaker reidentification by setting the `speaker_reidentification` parameter to true in your transcription request and provide the configuration through `speaker_reidentification_config`.

```json
{
  "speaker_reidentification": true,
  "speaker_reidentification_config": {
    "filters": {
      // Check options details for more information
      "customer_id": "123",
      "company": "gladia",
      "department": "tech"
    },
    "save_new_speakers": true,
    "save_new_speaker_similarity_threshold": 0.95,
    "boost_uuids": []
  }
}
```

**Options**

| Name | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `filters` | object | Filters to scope the speaker database search |
| `filters.customer_id` | string | Example of parameter called "customer_id" for scoping speaker search to a specific customer |
| `filters.company` | string | Example of parameter called "company" for scoping speaker search to a specific company that might be customer of your organization |
| `filters.department` | string | Example of parameter called "department" for further scoping to a specific department within a company that might be customer of your organization |
| `filters.xxx` | string | Example of parameter for further scoping you might need |
| `save_new_speakers` | boolean | Whether to save new speaker signatures to the database |
| `save_new_speaker_similarity_threshold` | float | Minimum similarity threshold (0-1) for saving new speakers (if we don't find a match withing this threshold) |
| `boost_uuids` | array | List of speaker UUIDs to prioritize in matching |


### Best Practices

- Always enable `diarization` when using speaker reidentification unless you have a specific reason not to (for instance speaker voiceprint registration)
- Use appropriate filters to narrow down the speaker database search scope
- Set a high `save_new_speaker_similarity_threshold` (e.g., 0.95) to ensure quality matches
- Use `boost_uuids` when you want to prioritize matching with specific known speakers

### Limitations

- Speaker reidentification requires good quality audio for accurate matching
- Performance may vary based on audio quality and background noise
- The feature works best with clear speech and minimal overlapping voices
