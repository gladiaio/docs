The **Named Entity Recognition** also known as **Entity Detection** feature helps you detect and categorize key information in the audio.

## Usage
Enable named entity recognition by setting ```named_entity_recognition``` to ```true``` in your transcription request.
```json
{
  "audio_url": "<your audio URL>"
  "named_entity_recognition": true
}
```
## Result
With this code, your output will look like this:

```json
{
  "transcription":{...}
  "named_entity_recognition": {
    "success": true,
    "is_empty": false,
    "results": [
      {
        "entity_type": "EMAIL_ADDRESS",
        "text": "privacy@gladia.io",
        "start": 1234,
        "end": 1245
      },
      {
        "entity_type": "AGE",
        "text": "27 years old",
        "start": 1247,
        "end": 1256
