**Named Entity Recognition** (also known as  **Entity Detection**) detects and categorizes key information in the audio.

## Usage
Enable named entity recognition by setting ```named_entity_recognition``` to ```true``` in your transcription request.
```json Request JSON
{
  "audio_url": "<your audio URL>"
  "named_entity_recognition": true
}
```
## Result
The transcription result will contain a ```"named_entity_recognition"``` key with the output of the model:

```json Result
{
  "transcription":{...}
  "named_entity_recognition": {
    "success": true,
    "is_empty": false,
    "results": [
      {
        "entity_type": "EMAIL_ADDRESS",
        "text": "privacy@gladia.io",
        "start": 123.4,
        "end": 124.5
      },
      {
        "entity_type": "AGE",
        "text": "27 years old",
        "start": 234.7,
        "end": 235.6
      }
    ],
    "exec_time": 1.7726809978485107,
