## Statistics Explanation

### Overall Statistics

- `total_duration`: Total duration of the audio in seconds.
- `total_words`: Total number of words in the transcription.
- `overall_wpm`: Average words per minute for the entire conversation.
- `number_of_speakers`: Number of distinct speakers detected.
- `avg_pause_duration`: Average duration of pauses in seconds.
- `overlap_duration`: Total duration of speech overlaps in seconds.
- `avg_response_time`: Average time between speaker turns in seconds.
- `most_frequent_words`: List of the most frequently used words, their count, and frequency.
- `silence_duration`: Total duration of silence in seconds.
- `silence_percentage`: Percentage of the audio that is silence.
- `conversational_balance`: Measures of how balanced the conversation is among speakers.
  - `speaking_time_gini_score`: Gini coefficient for speaking time distribution (0 = perfectly equal, 1 = completely unequal).
  - `word_count_gini_score`: Gini coefficient for word count distribution.

### Per-Speaker Statistics

For each speaker, the following metrics are provided:

- `wpm`: Words per minute for this speaker.
- `speaking_time_percentage`: Percentage of total speaking time for this speaker.
- `voice_clarity`: Measure of how clear the speaker's voice is (0-1).
- `longest_monologue`: Duration of the speaker's longest uninterrupted speech in seconds.
- `number_of_turns`: Number of times this speaker took a turn speaking.
- `vocabulary_diversity`: Measure of the variety of words used by the speaker (0-1).
- `avg_words_per_turn`: Average number of words spoken per turn.
- `filler_word_percentage`: Percentage of words that are fillers (um, uh, etc.).
- `question_percentage`: Percentage of the speaker's utterances that are questions.
- `interruption_rate`: Rate at which this speaker interrupts others.
- `speaking_speed_variation`: Variation in the speaker's talking speed.
- `type_token_ratio`: Ratio of unique words to total words (measure of vocabulary richness).
- `avg_utterance_length_words`: Average number of words per utterance.
- `avg_utterance_duration`: Average duration of utterances in seconds.
- `sentiment_score`: Overall sentiment of the speaker's words (-1 to 1, negative to positive).
- `dominance_score`: Measure of how dominant the speaker is in the conversation (0-1).

These statistics provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the conversation, speaking patterns of each participant, and overall characteristics of the transcribed audio.
