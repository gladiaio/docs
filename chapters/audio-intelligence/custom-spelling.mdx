You can customize how certain words, names or phrases are spelled in the final transcript.
<br/>To use custom spelling, provide a dictionary through the `custom_spelling_config` parameter. This dictionary should contain the correct spelling as the key and a list of one or more possible variations as the value.

Custom spelling is useful in scenarios where consistent spelling of specific words is crucial (e.g., technical terms in industry-specific recordings).

<Note>
The keys in the dictionary are case sensitive, while the values aren't. Values can contain multiple words.

```json Pre-recorded
{
  "custom_spelling": true,
  "custom_spelling_config": {
    "spelling_dictionary": {
      "Gorish": ["ghorish", "gaurish", "gaureish"],
      "Data Science": ["data-science", "data science"],
      ".": ["period", "full stop"],
      "SQL": ["sequel"]
    }
  }
}
```
```json Live
{
  "realtime_processing": {
    "custom_spelling": true,
    "custom_spelling_config": {
      "spelling_dictionary": {
        "Gorish": ["ghorish", "gaurish", "gaureish"],
        "Data Science": ["data-science", "data science"],
        ".": ["period", "full stop"],
        "SQL": ["sequel"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

In this example, the model will ensure that "Gorish" is spelled correctly throughout the transcript, even if it is pronounced in various ways such as "ghorish," "gaurish," or "gaureish."
