title: PII Redaction
description: "Automatically detect and redact personally identifiable information in pre-recorded transcripts"
---

**PII Redaction** automatically detects and replaces sensitive entities (names, emails, addresses, etc.) in your transcript output. This feature is only available for **pre-recorded** transcription.

## Usage

Add `"pii_redaction": true` to your request to redact all detected PII in the transcript. Sensitive entities will be replaced with markers in the output.

<CodeGroup>
```json Pre-recorded
{
  "audio_url": "YOUR_AUDIO_URL",
  "pii_redaction": true
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Optional configuration

You can customize the behavior with `pii_redaction_config`:

<ParamField body="entity_types" type="string[]">
  Preset or list of PII entity types to redact (e.g. `["GDPR"]`).
  See [Named Entity Recognition](/chapters/audio-intelligence/named-entity-recognition#supported-entities) for supported entity types.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="processed_text_type" type="string">
   How to replace detected PII: `"MARKER"` (placeholder labels like `[EMAIL_1]`) or `"MASK"` (masked characters).
</ParamField>

## Example body

```json
{
  "audio_url": "YOUR_AUDIO_URL",
  "pii_redaction": true,
  "pii_redaction_config": {
    "entity_types": ["GDPR"],
    "processed_text_type": "MARKER"
  }
}
```

## Example output

**Before (raw transcript):**

> Hi, I'm calling about the order for John Smith. Can you confirm the delivery to john.smith@company.com? Yes, John Smith placed it yesterday.

**After (with PII redaction):**

> Hi, I'm calling about the order for [NAME_1]. Can you confirm the delivery to [EMAIL_1]? Yes, [NAME_1] placed it yesterday.

The same entity mentioned multiple times receives the **same marker ID** (e.g. "John Smith" becomes [NAME_1] both times), so you can track references across the transcript while keeping sensitive data redacted. \
This consistency is also useful for downstream tasks using LLMs, which can reason about entities (e.g. "the person in [NAME_1]") without ever seeing the raw PII.
