## Gladia's playground

Using [Gladia's playground](https://app.gladia.io/playground/1) is a convenient way to test our Speech To Text API. On the playground
you are able to transcribe remote audio files through URL, and also upload your local audio files, alongside with live
audio transcription.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your audio source">
    Choose your audio source (stream from you microphone, or upload a local file)

    <Frame>
      <img src="/assets/images/playground-1.png" />
    </Frame>

    Then proceed to the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select features">
    You'll be able to select <Tooltip tip="If you want to see a complete list of the features Gladia's API provide check the Features section">some of
    the options</Tooltip> Gladia API provide for your transcription. \
    For this example, we want to detect the named entity (like email adresses, phone numbers, etc.), so we turned on **named entity recognition**.

    <Note>
      Only a few features of Gladia API are available on the playground. For more advanced testing,
      check [our API documentation](/api-reference/introduction/) instead.
    </Note>

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Talk to Gladia">
    You can talk to Gladia by clicking on the "Start transcribing" button, and you'll be able to see the transcription of your voice in the "Transcription" tab.
    <Note>
      Text in italic in the transcription represents [partials transcripts](/chapters/live-stt/features#partial-transcripts).
    </Note>

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transcribe">
    You can see an already formatted and readable results in the default "Transcription" tab, and you'll also find
    the result in JSON format (the one you'd get with an API call).

## Next steps

Now that you tested Gladia's basic transcription, you might want to extract data, enhance, translate or format your audio
transcriptions.

On top of its **Speech-to-text API**, Gladia provides a whole set of tools that you might want
to use for your particular use cases like:

* Speaker recognition (diarization)
* Audio intelligence models (Translation, Summarization, Chapterization, Custom AI process...)
* Word level timestamps
* Subtitles generation
* Custom vocabulary & Context prompting

Here are some links that can help you dive deeper into our powerful API:

* [Pre-recorded Speech To Text (STT) features](/chapters/pre-recorded-stt/features)
* [Live STT features](/chapters/live-stt/features)
* [Gladia code samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/gladiaio/gladia-samples)
* [API Reference](/api-reference/)
