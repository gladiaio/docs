## Next steps

Now that you tested Gladia's basic transcription, you might want to extract data, enhance, translate or format your audio
transcriptions.

On top of its **Speech-to-text API**, Gladia provides a whole set of tools that you might want
to use for your particular use cases like:

- Speaker recognition (diarization)
- Audio intelligence models (Translation, Summarization, Chapterization, Custom AI process...)
- Word level timestamps
- Subtitles generation
- Custom vocabulary & Context prompting

Here are some links that can help you dive deeper into our powerful API:

- [Pre-recorded Speech To Text (STT) features](/chapters/pre-recorded-stt/features)
- [Live STT features](/chapters/live-stt/features)
- [Gladia code samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/gladiaio/gladia-samples)
- [API Reference](/api-reference/)
