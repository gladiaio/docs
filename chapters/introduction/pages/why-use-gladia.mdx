# Running your own Whisper instance

In the dynamic world of technology, leveraging AI for voice recognition has become a key asset for many applications.
Whisper presents a cutting-edge solution.
However, setting up and maintaining your own Whisper instance can be fraught with challenges.
In this article, we dive into why managing your own Whisper instance might not be the best approach and how Gladia API seamlessly fills this gap.

## The Downside of Running Your Own Whisper Instance

### Resource-Heavy Requirements 🏋️‍♂️

<Callout type="warning">
  Running a Whisper instance is akin to training a heavyweight champion – it
  demands a lot of muscle (in terms of computational power) and endurance
  (continuous data processing).
</Callout>

- **Intensive Computing Needs**: Whisper models are like power-hungry giants, requiring substantial CPU and GPU power.
- **Enormous Storage Space**: Prepare to allocate extensive storage for datasets and model weights, akin to building large warehouses for data.

### Navigating the Maze of Technical Complexity 🤖

<Callout type="info">
  Setting up a Whisper instance is not a walk in the park. It's more like
  navigating a labyrinth, where technical expertise is your only guide.
</Callout>

- **Daunting Setup and Maintenance**: The complexity of configuration and ongoing maintenance can be overwhelming.
- **Staying Ahead of the Curve**: Keeping up with the latest advancements in AI technology requires constant vigilance and learning.

### Security Concerns: A Thorny Issue 🛡️

- **Data Privacy Risks**: Storing sensitive voice data on your own servers can be like opening a Pandora's box of privacy issues.
- **Attack Vulnerability**: Self-hosted solutions could be more susceptible to cyber-attacks, making them a potential Achilles' heel.

### Cost: The Hidden Giant 💸

- **Ongoing Operational Expenses**: The high computational demands translate into increased electricity and cooling costs.
- **Initial Investment in Hardware**: Get ready to invest in high-end hardware, akin to buying a sports car for a daily commute.
