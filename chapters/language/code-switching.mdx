description: "Transcribe conversations that mix multiple languages in real time or pre-recorded"
---

Code switching handles conversations where speakers switch languages mid-utterance or across turns. Gladia can detect and transcribe the active language dynamically, and annotate results with the detected languages code.

<Note>
  For best accuracy and latency, provide a small set of expected languages. Avoid listing dozens of similar languages.
</Note>

## How to use code switching ?

Enable code switching in the session configuration:

```json
{
  "encoding": "wav/pcm",
  "sample_rate": 16000,
  "bit_depth": 16,
  "channels": 1,
  "language_config": {
    "languages": ["en", "de", "fr"],
    "code_switching": true
  }
}
```

When enabled, transcript messages include the detected `language` per utterance and per word. Use the [`transcript` message](/api-reference/v2/live/message/transcript) schema for details.

<Tip>
  You can also omit `languages` to allow detection across all supported languages, but constraining the set usually improves accuracy.
</Tip>

## Recommendations

- Limit the number of languages to those you expect.
- Combine with [custom vocabulary](/chapters/pre-recorded-stt/features#custom-vocabulary) per language for domain terms.
