description: "How to let Gladia detect the spoken language automatically"

Gladia can automatically detect the spoken language from audio, either within a candidate set you provide or across all supported languages.

<Note>
  Provide a small list of likely languages when possible. It improves accuracy and reduces latency.
</Note>

## How to use language detection ?

You can either omit `language_config.languages` to search across all supported languages, or pass a constrained list:

<CodeGroup>

```json Detect across all languages
{
  "encoding": "wav/pcm",
  "sample_rate": 16000,
  "bit_depth": 16,
  "channels": 1,
  "language_config": {
    "languages": [],
    "code_switching": false
  }
}
```

```json Detect within a set of languages
{
  "encoding": "wav/pcm",
  "sample_rate": 16000,
  "bit_depth": 16,
  "channels": 1,
  "language_config": {
    "languages": ["en", "de", "fr"],
    "code_switching": false
  }
}
```



</CodeGroup>

The detected `language` is returned on each utterance and can vary over time if you also enable <a href="/chapters/language/code-switching">code switching</a>.

## Tips

- Use <a href="/chapters/language/supported-languages">supported languages</a> to pick valid ISO 639-1 codes.
- Combine with `messages_config.receive_partial_transcripts` in real time to get immediate feedback.
- For mixed-language conversations, enable <a href="/chapters/language/code-switching">code switching</a>.
