title: 'Speaker Diarization'
description: 'Detect speakers and understand who said what.'
---


Speaker diarization is the process of detecting multiple speakers in an audio, and understanding which parts of the transcription each speaker said.

## Enabling diarization

Diarization is enabled by sending the `diarization` parameter in the transcription request:
```json
{
  "audio_url": "<your audio URL>",
  "diarization": true
}
```

## Enabling enhanced diarization (beta)

<Note>
This feature is in a **Beta** state.<br/>
Breaking changes may still be introduced to this API, but an advanced notice will be sent. 

We're looking for feedback to improve this feature, [share yours here](https://gladiaio.typeform.com/feedback?typeform-source=app.gladia.io).
</Note>

For improved diarization handling edge cases and challenging audio, you can enable enhanced diarization by using the `enhanced` parameter in the `diarization_config` object.

```json
{
  "audio_url": "<your audio URL>",
  "diarization": true,
  "diarization_config": {
    "enhanced": true
  },
}
```

## Response
When `diarization` or `enhanced diarization` is enabled, each utterance will contain a `speaker` field, whose value is an index representing the speaker.
Speakers will be assigned indexes by **order of appearance** (i.e. the 1st speaker will be speaker 0, the 2nd speaker 1, etc).

## Improving diarization accuracy

<Tip> The following parameters are only available for the `diarization` model. `enhanced diarization` does not support those yet. </Tip>

You can improve the accuracy of the diarization by providing the model with hints regarding the expected number or lower/upper bounds ofspeakers using the `diarization_config.num_of_speakers`, `diarization_config.min_speakers` and `diarization_config.max_speakers`  parameters respectively.

**Important:** These parameters are hints, not hard constraints. The actual number of speakers detected by the model may not comply with the provided parameters.

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `diarization_config.number_of_speakers` | number | Guiding number of speakers - instructs the model to detect an exact number of speakers in the audio. |
| `diarization_config.min_speakers` | number | Instructs the model to detect no less than this number of speakers in the audio. |
| `diarization_config.max_speakers` | number | Causes the model to detect no more than this number of speakers in the audio. |
