Enhanced punctuation improves both the accuracy and natural flow of punctuation in transcriptions. It ensures precise comma placement, natural sentence breaks, and better handling of quotation marks.

Example:

**Standard:** "hello how are you today I am doing fine thanks"  
**Enhanced:** "Hello, how are you today? I am doing fine, thanks!"

Enable it by sending the `punctuation_enhanced` parameter:

```json
{
  "audio_url": "YOUR_AUDIO_URL",
  "punctuation_enhanced": true
}
```
