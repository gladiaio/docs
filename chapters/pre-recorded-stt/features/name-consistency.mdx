title: "Name consistency"
description: "Ensure consistent spelling of names across the transcript"
---

You can ask the model to enforce consistent spelling of names using the `name_consistency` parameter. This ensures the same name is spelled the same way throughout the transcript, at the cost of a small amount of added processing time.

This is especially useful where people's names may be mentioned multiple times but are not known in advance (e.g., recruitment call recordings).
To ensure correct spelling of names known in advance, use [custom vocabulary](/chapters/pre-recorded-stt/custom-vocabulary).

```json request data
{
  "audio_url": "YOUR_AUDIO_URL",
  "name_consistency": true
}
```
