description: "Semantic sentence segmentation for more readable results"

In addition to getting the transcription split by utterances, you can request semantic sentence segmentation for more readable results.

<Tip>
You can get translated sentences by enabling both `sentences` and `translation`! You'll receive sentences output for the original transcript, and each `translation` result will also contain sentences in the translated language.
</Tip>

```json request data
{
  "sentences": true
}
```

The result will contain a `sentences` key (in addition to `utterances`):

```json
"sentences": {
  "success": true,
  "is_empty": false,
  "results": [
    {
      "sentence": "Amy, it says you are trained in technology.",
      "start": 0.4681999999999999,
      "end": 2.45525,
      "words": [...],
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "language": "en",
      "speaker": 0,
      "channel": 0
    }
  ]
}
```
