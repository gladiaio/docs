If your audio file has multiple distinct channels, Gladia will transcribe them automatically. In the result, each utterance includes a `channel` key corresponding to the source channel.

<Warning>
Sending an audio with two different channels (with different content) will be billed as two audios. If your audio has multiple channels with the same content, it will only be billed once.

TL;DR: We charge every unique channel in an audio file; we do not charge if channels are duplicates.
</Warning>
