Gladia provides word-level timestamps by default in pre-recorded transcriptions.

Under each utterance, you'll find a `words` property like this:

```json
// other properties...
"utterances": [
  {
    "words": [
      {
        "word": "Split",
        "start": 0.21001999999999998,
        "end": 0.69015,
        "confidence": 1
      },
      {
        "word": " infinity",
        "start": 0.91021,
        "end": 1.55038,
        "confidence": 0.95
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
