 into written text. This serves as the basis for all Gladia API offerings.

 Additional capabilities, like Speaker Diarization, Summarization, Translation, Custom Prompts and more can be integrated seamlessly
 into the transcription process by including extra parameters in the transcription request.


## Export SRT or VTT caption files

You can export completed transcripts in both SRT and VTT format, which can be used for subtitles and captions in videos.

<Tip>
You can use the `subtitles` feature alongside the `translation` feature. 
You'll have your subtitles in the original language, and **also** in languages you targeted for the translation!
