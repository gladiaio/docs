title: Audio Intelligence
description: "Turn speech into actionable insights with translation, summarization, entities, chapters, sentiment and more"
---

Audio intelligence turns raw speech into structured, useful data on top of transcription. Once the words are captured, these features help you understand, organize, and act on the content — from instant translation to key-point summaries, entity detection, chapter markers, emotions, and even custom LLM prompts.
