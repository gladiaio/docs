# Data retention

By default, Gladia stores transcription data to allow users to retrieve results, original audio, debug issues, and replay workflow.

Enterprise users are eligible for custom data retention and zero data retention option.

| **Plan type** | **Data retention (days)** | **Zero data retention** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enterprise | Custom (up to 24 hours) | On demand |
| Paid | Up to 12 months | No |
| Free | Up to 12 months | No |

Depending on your configuration, Gladia may process the following data:

| Data type | Description | Data retention (N days) | Zero Data retention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Audio input | Audio files or audio streams provided for transcription | Fully accessible for N days. Deleted after N days. | Not stored |
| Transcription output | Text, timestamps, words, utterances | Fully accessible for N days. Deleted after N days. | Not stored |
| Metadata | Request IDs, timestamps, processing status | Fully accessible for N days. Minimal after N days for usage monitoring. | Minimal for usage monitoring. |
| Logs | Operational logs for system reliability | Immutable | Immutable |

### Zero Data Retention behavior

When Zero Data Retention is enabled, Gladia processes data ephemerally.

### Key guarantees

- No audio files are stored
- No transcripts are stored
- No results are persisted
- No replay or retrieval is possible

Once the result is delivered, all data is immediately deleted.

## API behavior for asynchronous and real-time

Zero Data Retention intentionally changes how the API behaves.

- File uploads are disabled. Only `audio_url` inputs are supported on the asynchronous API.
- Results are delivered **only via callbacks or webhooks**
- Polling or later retrieval is not supported
