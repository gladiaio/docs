To provide transcription services, Gladia processes several types of data:
- **Audio input**: Audio files or audio streams provided for transcription
- **Transcription output**: Text, timestamps, words, utterances
- **API Metadata**: Request IDs, timestamps, processing status
- **Logs**: Operational logs for system reliability

The duration for which your data is stored depends on your plan type. You have two main options for data retention:

- **Standard data retention:** Your data (such as audio files, transcripts, and metadata) remains accessible for a set number of days, up to a maximum allowed by your plan. The minimum retention value is 0, which means your data is deleted within 24 hours. The maximum and default value is 12 months.
- **Zero data retention:** Data storage is minimized at all stages, avoiding temporary storage whenever possible. All data is deleted immediately after processing.

<Info>
Only Enterprise users are eligible for custom data retention and the zero data retention option.

To enable usage tracking, Gladia retains essential API metadata: request ID, timestamp, processing status and audio duration. Immutable logs are also maintained, for a limited period, to ensure service quality and reliability.

## Zero Data Retention behavior

When Zero Data Retention is enabled, Gladia processes data ephemerally; no data is stored at rest.

- **No audio files are stored**: Files cannot be retrieved through the API or in the [Gladia's playground](https://app.gladia.io/?utm_campaign=197609689-Website&utm_source=documentation&utm_content=sign-up). File upload is also disabled; the asynchronous API must use `audio_url` inputs.
- **No transcripts are stored**: Transcription results cannot be retrieved through the API and are not visible in the [Gladia's playground](https://app.gladia.io/?utm_campaign=197609689-Website&utm_source=documentation&utm_content=sign-up).
- **No metadata retrieval**: Transcription API calls, audio duration, and other metadata cannot be retrieved through the API or in the [Gladia's playground](https://app.gladia.io/?utm_campaign=197609689-Website&utm_source=documentation&utm_content=sign-up).

Once the result is delivered, the audio, transcript, and metadata cannot be accessed.
