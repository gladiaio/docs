- **Usage limit** : (**free-tier** users only)

  This determines the number of hours a user can transcribe a given month. This is a limitation for free tier users only.

- **Concurrency** : (depending on free/paid tier)

  This refers to the maximum number of transcription or live transcriptions that a user can process at the same time.

- **API level rate limit** : (same for every user)

  Which is the number of API calls that a user can make within a particular time frame.
  This is to ensure that a single user or malicious actor doesn't affect the performance of the API for all the other users.
