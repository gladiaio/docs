## What is n8n?
n8n is a fair-code workflow automation platform that lets you connect apps and APIs with flexible, no-code/low-code workflows.

By connecting n8n with **Gladia’s speech-to-text (STT) service**, you can build automated pipelines that transcribe, translate, and analyze audio files — and push the results into your favorite tools like Notion, Slack, or CRMs.

## What You Can Build
- Automated transcription workflows that save meeting recordings into Google Docs or Notion.
- Podcast and video content pipelines that generate transcripts and push them to CMS tools.
- Customer support bots and CRMs that log call transcripts directly into HubSpot or Salesforce.
- Multilingual operations with automatic translation of audio for global teams.


## Quickstart with Gladia + n8n
Gladia doesn’t have a native n8n node, but you can integrate easily with the HTTP Request node.
Here’s the recommended workflow:

### 1. Get Set Up
    1. Create a Gladia account
    2. Get your API key from the dashboard
    3. Set up a webhook URL in your dashboard so Gladia can send back transcription events

### 2. Upload or Send Audio to Gladia

In n8n:
    1. Add an HTTP Request node
    2. Configure it to send a POST request to Gladia’s upload endpoint if your file is not public:
    `POST` https://api.gladia.io/v2/upload
    3. Add your API Key in the headers (`x-gladia-key`: `YOUR_API_KEY`)
    4. Send the audio file as `multipart/form-data`
If your file is already publicly accessible → you can skip this upload step and directly provide the URL in the transcription request (see next step).

### 3. Request a Transcription

    1. Add another HTTP Request node
    2. Configure it as a POST request to Gladia’s transcription endpoint:
        Include either:
        - The file URL you got from the upload response, or
        - The publicly accessible audio file URL

### 4. Receive the Webhook Event

Once Gladia completes the transcription, it will send a webhook event to the URL you configured in your dashboard.

In n8n, you can set up a Webhook Trigger node to capture this event.

### 5. Retrieve the Transcription Result
    1. Add an HTTP Request node configured as a GET request to Gladia’s API
    2. Use the id from the webhook event to fetch the final transcript
    
This can then kick off the next steps in your workflow.
