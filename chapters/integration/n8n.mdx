### What is n8n?
n8n is a fair-code workflow automation platform that lets you connect apps and APIs with flexible, no-code/low-code workflows.

By connecting n8n with **Gladiaâ€™s speech-to-text (STT) service**, you can build automated pipelines that transcribe, translate, and analyze audio files â€” and push the results into your favorite tools like Notion, Slack, or CRMs.

### What You Can Build
Automated meeting transcriptions â†’ Save call recordings into Notion or Google Docs
Podcast & video pipelines â†’ Generate transcripts and send them to your CMS
Customer support CRMs â†’ Log call transcripts into HubSpot, Salesforce, or other CRMs
Multilingual workflows â†’ Automatically translate audio for global teams


### Quickstart with Gladia + n8n
Gladia doesnâ€™t have a native n8n node, but you can integrate easily with the HTTP Request node.
Hereâ€™s the recommended workflow:

1. Get Set Up
    - Create a Gladia account
    - Get your API key from the dashboard
    - Set up a webhook URL in your dashboard so Gladia can send back transcription events

2. Upload or Send Audio to Gladia

In n8n:
    - Add an HTTP Request node
    - Configure it to send a POST request to Gladiaâ€™s Upload endpoint if your file is not public:
    `POST` https://api.gladia.io/audio/text/audio-transcription/
    - Add your API Key in the headers (Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`)
    - Send the audio file as `multipart/form-data`
If your file is already publicly accessible â†’ you can skip this upload step and directly provide the URL in the transcription request (see next step).

3. Request a Transcription
    
    - Add another HTTP Request node
    - Configure it as a POST request to Gladiaâ€™s transcription endpoint:
        Include either:
        - The file URL you got from the upload response, or
        - The publicly accessible audio file URL

4. Receive the Webhook Event

Once Gladia completes the transcription, it will send a webhook event to the URL you configured in your dashboard.
In n8n, you can set up a Webhook Trigger node to capture this event.
This can then kick off the next steps in your workflow.
ðŸ‘‰ If the event is a success, it will contain an id that you can use to make a GET request to retrieve the final transcript

5. Retrieve the Transcription Result
    - Add an HTTP Request node configured as a GET request to Gladiaâ€™s API
    - Use the id from the webhook event to fetch the final transcript
    - The JSON response will include fields like status and text
