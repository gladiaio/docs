## What is Pipecat?

Pipecat is an open‑source framework for building realtime, voice‑first AI agents. It orchestrates audio input/output, speech‑to‑text (STT), large language models (LLMs), and text‑to‑speech (TTS) into one low‑latency pipeline you can run on the server and connect to from the browser or native apps. With Pipecat’s Gladia STT service, you can plug Gladia’s accurate, low‑latency transcription directly into your agent.
