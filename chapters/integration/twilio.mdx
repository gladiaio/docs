## What is Twilio

Twilio is a cloud platform that lets you add voice, messaging, and video to your apps with simple APIs. Instead of worrying about telecom infrastructure, you can focus on your product. In this guide, we'll use Twilio for voice with Gladia Speech-to-Text.

## Twilio Media Streams

Twilio Programmable Voice lets you make and receive calls. Media Streams can send real-time audio from a live call to your server over WebSocket. When connected to Gladia's low-latency Speech-to-Text (STT), you get instant transcription. This powers real-time voice agents, call analytics, compliance tools, and live captions.

<Tip>
  Want the full API reference? Check the official Twilio Media Streams docs:
