## What is Recall?

Recall.ai provides a unified Meeting Bot API that can join Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, and Slack calls, stream audio in real time, and route it to providers for transcription and intelligence. With Gladia STT connected in Recall.ai, you get accurate, low‑latency transcription for your calls without building any of the bot or RTC plumbing yourself.
