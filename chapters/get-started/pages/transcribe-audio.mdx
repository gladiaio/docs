<Tip> Every references, assumptions, and commands mentioning "audio files" are also true & works for video files. </Tip>

## ðŸ¤– Using your terminal with cURL command

If you are a developer, you probably want to check our [API Documentation](/api-reference/).  

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file-audio" title="Transcribe local audio files">
    You'll need:

    - Your local audio file (referred as *YOUR_LOCAL_AUDIO_FILE* in the below example)
    - Your Gladia API key (referred as *YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY* in the below example)

    First, we need to upload your local file to Gladia API : 

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/upload \
      --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
      --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY' \
      --form audio=@/path/to/your/audio/conversation.wav
    ```

    If your upload succeeded, you'll get a response of type :

    ```json
    {
      "audio_url":"https://api.gladia.io/file/43a853cf-990e-43c3-8c5d-594c0b2bfc95",
      "audio_metadata":
        {
          "id":"43a853cf-990e-43c3-8c5d-594c0b2bfc95",
          "filename": "conversation.wav",
          "extension": "wav",
          "size": 1813648,
          "audio_duration": 26.555465,
          "nb_channels": 2
        }
    }
    ```

    - `audio_url` : The audio URL we'll use to send the transcription request
    - `audio_metadata` : Metadata we got from your audio files

    Now that you have an audio link, you can proceed with the **"Transcribe audio links"** part ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="globe" title="Transcribe audio links">
    You'll need:

    - Your audio link URL (referred as *YOUR_AUDIO_LINK_URL* in the below example)
    - Your Gladia API key (referred as *YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY* in the below example)

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY' \
      --data '{
      "audio_url": "YOUR_AUDIO_LINK_URL"
      }'
    ```

    If your transcription request is accepted, you'll get a response of type :

    ```json
    {
      "id": "40aae358-6bfd-4c01-bf1d-0fc7c0f02707",
      "result_url": "https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription/40aae358-6bfd-4c01-bf1d-0fc7c0f02707"
    }
    ```

    - `id` : Your transcription ID
    - `result_url` : A pre-built URL for convenience to fetch your result

    At this stage, your transcription is queued and will be processed  shortly. To check its status and/or get its result, use the 
    `result_url` we provided you:

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription/40aae358-6bfd-4c01-bf1d-0fc7c0f02707 \
      --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY'
    ```

    You should get a JSON response like this :

    ```json
    {
      "id": "40aae358-6bfd-4c01-bf1d-0fc7c0f02707",
      "request_id": "G-99eaeae8",
      "kind": "pre-recorded",
      "status": "done",
      ...
      "request_params": {
        "audio_url": "http://files.gladia.io/example/audio-transcription/split_infinity.wav",
        "translation": true,
        "translation_config": {
          "model": "base",
          "target_languages": [
            "fr",
            "es"
          ]
        }
      },
      "result": {
        "metadata": {
          "audio_duration": 20.555465,
          "number_of_distinct_channels": 1,
          "billing_time": 20.555465,
          "transcription_time": 21.047
        },
        "transcription": {
          "full_transcript": "Split infinity in a time when less is more where too much is never enough there is always hope for the future the future can be read from the past the past foreshadows the present and the present hasn't been written yet"
        },
        ...
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
    Ta-da ðŸŽ‰ you just made your first transcription!

## ðŸŽ® Using our playground

Using [Gladia's playground](https://app.gladia.io/playground/1) is a convenient way to test our speech to text API. On the playground
you are able to transcribe remote audio files through URL, and also upload your local audio files, alongside with live 
audio transcription.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your audio source">
    Choose your audio source (using an audio link, or upload a local file)
    <Frame>
      <img src='/assets/images/playground-1.png'/>
    </Frame>
    Then proceed to the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select features">
    You'll be able to select <Tooltip tip="If you want to see a complete list of the features Gladia's API provide check the Features section">some of 
    the options</Tooltip> Gladia API provide for your transcription.
    For this example, we want to detect the speakers, so we turned on **diarization**.

    <Note>
        Only a few features of Gladia API are available on the playground. For more advanced testing,
        check [our API documentation](/api-reference/) instead. 
     </Note>

    <Frame>
      <img src='/assets/images/playground-2.png'/>
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transcribe">

    You can see an already formatted and readable results in the default "Transcription" tab, and you'll also find
     the result in various format (plain text, SRT, VTT) and JSON (the one youâ€™d get with an API call).
