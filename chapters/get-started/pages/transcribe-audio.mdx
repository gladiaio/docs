<Tip> Every references, assumptions, and commands mentionning "audio files" are also true & works for video files. </Tip>


## ðŸ¤– Using your terminal with cURL command

If you are a developper, you probably want to check our [API Documentation](/api-reference/)
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="file-audio" title="Transcribe local audio files">
    You'll need:

    - Your local audio file (refered as *YOUR_LOCAL_AUDIO_FILE* in the below example)
    - Your Gladia API key (refered as *YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY* in the below example)

    First, we need to upload your local file to Gladia API : 

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/upload \
      --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
      --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY' \
      --form audio=@/path/to/your/audio/conversation.wav
    ```

    If your upload succeeded, you'll get a response of type :

    ```json
    {
      "audio_url":"https://api.gladia.io/file/43a853cf-990e-43c3-8c5d-594c0b2bfc95",
      "audio_metadata":
        {
          "id":"43a853cf-990e-43c3-8c5d-594c0b2bfc95",
          "filename": "conversation.wav",
          "extension": "wav",
          "size": 1813648,
          "audio_duration": 26.555465,
          "nb_channels": 2
        }
    }
    ```

    - `audio_url` : The audio URL we'll use to send the transcription request
    - `audio_metadata` : Metadata we got from your audio files

    Now that you have an audio link, you can proceed with the **"Transcribe audio links"** part ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="globe" title="Transcribe audio links">
    You'll need:

    - Your audio link URL (refered as *YOUR_AUDIO_LINK_URL* in the below example)
    - Your Gladia API key (refered as *YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY* in the below example)

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY' \
      --data '{
      "audio_url": "YOUR_AUDIO_LINK_URL"
      }'
    ```

    If your transcription request succeeded, you'll get a response of type :

    ```json
    {
      "id": "40aae358-6bfd-4c01-bf1d-0fc7c0f02707",
      "result_url": "https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription/40aae358-6bfd-4c01-bf1d-0fc7c0f02707"
    }
    ```

    - `id` : Your transcription ID
    - `result_url` : A pre-built URL for convenience to fetch your XPathResult

    Then you'll be able to fetch your result in JSON format using the `result_url` we provided you:

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api.gladia.io/v2/transcription/40aae358-6bfd-4c01-bf1d-0fc7c0f02707 \
      --header 'x-gladia-key: YOUR_GLADIA_API_KEY'
    ```

    Ta-da ðŸŽ‰ you just made your first transcription !

## ðŸŽ® Using our playground

Using [Gladia's playground](https://app.gladia.io/playground/1) is a conveniant way to test our speech to text API. On the playground
you are able to transcribe remote audio files through URL, and also upload your local audio files, alongside with live 
audio transcription.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your audio source">
    Choose your audio source (using an audio link, or upload a local file)
    <Frame>

    </Frame>
    Then proceed to the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select features">

        check [our API documentation](/api-reference/) instead.
