## What is LiveKit Agents?

LiveKit Agents is a framework for building real‑time, voice‑enabled AI applications that connect to LiveKit rooms. It lets you compose speech‑to‑text (STT), large language models (LLMs), and text‑to‑speech (TTS) to create interactive agents that can hear, think, and speak in low‑latency pipelines. With the Gladia STT integration, your agents benefit from accurate, fast transcription.

<Tip>
  Looking for the full API and options? See the official LiveKit Gladia STT
  docs:
  [docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/stt/gladia](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/stt/gladia/).
