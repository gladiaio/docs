## What is Vapi?

Vapi is a developer platform for building real-time voice AI agents across phone, web, SIP, and WebSocket transports. It orchestrates audio I/O, LLM reasoning, and TTS—and lets you plug in your preferred STT. With the Gladia STT integration, your Vapi assistants get accurate, low-latency transcription in 90+ languages. See the official Gladia provider page in Vapi’s docs for fields and options.

## What you can build
- Realtime voice agents on phone, web, or WebSocket streams
- Live captions for calls and embedded voice experiences
- IVR and customer-support bots that understand accents and code-switching
- Multilingual assistants with diarization and optional translation layers 

## Quickstart (configure Gladia as Vapi transcriber)
    1. Get a Gladia API key from the Gladia dashboard. 
    2. In Vapi, open your Dashboard ➜ Assistant ➜ Transcriber tab and select Gladia.

    4. Choose options (e.g., language/auto-detect, diarization). See Vapi’s Gladia page for supported parameters. 
    5. Test a call using Vapi’s Web UI or the WebSocket transport to stream audio from your app.
