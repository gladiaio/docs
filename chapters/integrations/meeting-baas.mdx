## What is Meeting BaaS?

Meeting BaaS provides a unified API for Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams so you can record and transcribe meetings through one service. By connecting Gladia STT, you leverage Gladia’s accurate, feature‑rich transcription for your meeting recordings without building the capture and RTC plumbing yourself.

<Tip>
  Looking for API details and options? See the Meeting BaaS docs:
  [docs.meetingbaas.com](https://docs.meetingbaas.com/) and the Gladia docs
  [docs.gladia.io](https://docs.gladia.io/).

## Quickstart via API

There are two main ways to use Gladia with Meeting BaaS.

### Create a bot with Gladia as the STT provider

When creating a bot to join a meeting, specify Gladia as the speech‑to‑text provider:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots" \
  -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: <MEETING_BAAS_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
          "meeting_url": "https://meet.google.com/xyz-abc",
          "speech_to_text": "Gladia",
          "webhook_url": "https://yourapp.com/webhook"
       }'
```

### Retranscribe an existing recording with Gladia

For existing recordings, use the Retranscribe Bot API to process audio with Gladia:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.meetingbaas.com/bots/retranscribe" \
  -H "x-meeting-baas-api-key: <MEETING_BAAS_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bot_uuid": "string",
    "speech_to_text": {
      "api_key": "<GLADIA_API_KEY>",
      "provider": "Gladia"
    },
