## What is VideoSDK?

VideoSDK is a platform that provides real-time video, audio, and interactive live streaming infrastructure. Its AI Agents framework lets you build voice-first AI agents that can join video calls, listen to participants, and respond in real time. With the Gladia STT plugin, your VideoSDK AI agents get accurate, low-latency transcription out of the box.
