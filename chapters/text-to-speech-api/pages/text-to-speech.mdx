description: "Guide on using Pre Recorded Text To Speech API for audio synthesis from text."
---

This API allows you to synthesize audio from text using two different modes: with pre-recorded speaker voices or with a cloned speaker voice. 
Depending on your needs, you can choose the voice that best fits your project from a wide selection of pre-recorded voices, 
or you can opt to clone a specific voice using a provided audio file.

### Modes of Operation

1. **Pre-recorded Speaker Voices**:
This mode uses a library of pre-recorded voices. 
You can select a voice that suits your requirements and provide the text you wish to synthesize. 
The API will then generate audio using the selected voice. 
The available voices include but are not limited to Claribel Dervla, Daisy Studious, Gracie Wise, and many more. 
Each voice has its unique tone and style, providing a range of options for your audio content.

2. **Cloned Speaker Voice**: 
If you require a more personalized voice, this mode allows you to clone a specific voice from an audio file you provide. 
This is particularly useful for creating a unique voice for your brand or for specific characters in storytelling applications.

### Request Format

To use the API, send a POST request to `/text/audio/audio-synthesis/` with a JSON payload specifying the `speaker_voice_behaviour` (either `"pre recorded voice"` or `"cloned voice"`), the chosen `pre_recorded_speaker_voice` or `cloned_speaker_voice` file (if applicable), the `text` to be synthesized, and the `language`.

### Response

The API responds with an audio file at 24,000 Hz in WAV/PCM format, allowing for high-quality audio output suitable for various applications, from virtual assistants to audio books.

### Example
Here is an example of payload for a pre recorded voice:
POST https://api.gladia.io/text/audio/audio-synthesis/
```json
{
  "speaker_voice_behaviour": "pre recorded voice",
  "pre_recorded_speaker_voice": "Claribel Dervla",
  "text": "Hello, welcome to our Text to Speech API. This is an example using a pre-recorded speaker voice.",
  "language": "en"
}
```
Here is an example of payload for a cloned speaker voice voice:
POST https://api.gladia.io/text/audio/audio-synthesis/
```json
{
  "speaker_voice_behaviour": "cloned voice",
  "cloned_speaker_voice": "file_path_to_cloned_voice_sample.wav",
  "text": "This is an example using a cloned speaker voice.",
  "language": "en"
}
```

### Supported Languages

The API supports a variety of languages, including english (en), spanish (es), french (fr), german (de), italian (it), portuguese (pt), polish (pl), turkish (tr), russian (ru), dutch (nl), czech (cs), arabic (ar), chinese (zh-cn), hungarian (hu), korean (ko), japanese (ja), and hindi (hi). This wide range of supported languages makes it easy to create audio content for a global audience.
