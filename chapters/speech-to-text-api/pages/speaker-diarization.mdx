description: 'Detect speakers and understand who said what.'

Speaker diarization is the process of detecting multiple speakers in an audio, and understanding which parts of the transcription each speaker said.

## Enabling diarization

Diarization is enabled by sending the `diarization` parameter in the transcription request:
```json
{
  "audio_url": "<your audio URL>"
  "diarization": true
}
```

## Response
When **diarization** is enabled, each utterance will contain a `speaker` field, whose value is an index representing the speaker.
Speakers will be assigned indexes by **order of appearance** (i.e. the 1st speaker will be speaker 0, the 2nd speaker 1, etc).

```json
{
  "transcription": {
    "utterances": [
      {
        "words": [...],
        "text": "it says you are trained in technology.",
        "language": "en",
        "start": 0.7334100000000001,
        "end": 2.364,
        "confidence": 0.8914285714285715,
        "channel": 0
        "speaker": 0,
      }
      ...
}
```

## Improving diarization accuracy
You can improve the accuracy of the diarization by providing the model with hints regarding the expected number or lower/upper bounds ofspeakers using the `diarization_config.num_of_speakers`, `diarization_config.min_speakers` and `diarization_config.max_speakers`  parameters respectively.

**Important:** These parameters are hints, not hard constraints. The actual number of speakers detected by the model may not comply with the provided parameters.

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `diarization_config.number_of_speakers` | number | Guiding number of speakers - instructs the model to detect an exact number of speakers in the audio. |
| `diarization_config.min_speakers` | number | Instructs the model to detect no less than this number of speakers in the audio. |
| `diarization_config.max_speakers` | number | Causes the model to detect no more than this number of speakers in the audio. |
