### Configuration

You have nothing to configure. If you have multiple channels in your audio file with different content, the API will automatically transcribe each of them.

### Results

Each utterance will include a `channel` key, indicating the channel from which the utterance came from.

```json
{
  "utterances": [
    {
      "text": "Vi tester en ganske kort melding.",
      "language": "no",
      "start": 1.02077,
      "end": 3.9749399999999997,
      "confidence": 0.86,
      "channel": 0,
      "speaker": 0,
      "words": [...]
    },
    {...}
  ],
}
```

<Note>
The cost of transcribing an audio with multiple channels increases proportionally to the number of channels. For instance, a 2-channel audio will be billed double the audio duration, unless both channels are identical.

### Configuration

If you have multiple channels in your audio stream, specify it in the `channels` parameter.

```json
{
  "channels": 2
}
```

### Results

Each utterance will include a `channel` key, indicating the channel from which the utterance came from.

```json Real-Time

  {
    "type": "transcript",
    "session_id": "...",
    "created_at": "2025-01-17T09:01:30.197Z",
    "data": {

        "channel": 0,
        "words": [...]
      }
    }
  },
}
```

<Note>
The cost of transcribing an audio stream with multiple channels increases proportionally to the number of channels. For instance, a 2-channel audio stream will be billed as double the audio duration, even if both channels contain identical audio.
