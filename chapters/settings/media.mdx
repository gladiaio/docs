## Encoding, Bit depth and Sample rate

When submitting audio to Gladia’s Real-Time API, you must provide additional information as headerless audio packets are sent to the streaming endpoint. <br/>
**Make sure to provide the correct information.**

We are currently supporting:
- PCM: 8, 16, 24, and 32 bits
- A-law: 8 bits
- μ-law: 8 bits

You don't need to add WAV headers to the raw audio as the API supports both formats. For the sample rate, the available options are 8000, 16000, 32000, 44100, 48000.

```json
{
  "encoding": "wav/pcm",
  "bit_depth": 16,
  "sample_rate": 16000,
}
```


## Multi-channels

Gladia supports audio transcription with multiple data channels. Multi-channel audio can be useful when each channel represents a different speaker to ensure an accurate speaker diarization.

### Configuration

You have nothing to configure. If you have multiple channels in your audio file with different content, the API will automatically transcribe each of them.

### Results

Each utterance will include a `channel` key, indicating the channel from which the utterance came from.

```json
{
  "utterances": [
    {
      "text": "Vi tester en ganske kort melding.",
      "language": "no",
      "start": 1.02077,
      "end": 3.9749399999999997,
      "confidence": 0.86,
      "channel": 0,
      "speaker": 0,
      "words": [...]
    },
    {...}
  ],
}
```

<Note>
The cost of transcribing an audio with multiple channels increases proportionally to the number of channels. For instance, a 2-channel audio will be billed double the audio duration, unless both channels are identical.

### Configuration

If you have multiple channels in your audio stream, specify it in the `channels` parameter.

```json
{
  "channels": 2
}
```

### Results

Each utterance will include a `channel` key, indicating the channel from which the utterance came from.

```json Real-Time

      }
    }
  },
}
```

<Note>
The cost of transcribing an audio stream with multiple channels increases proportionally to the number of channels. For instance, a 2-channel audio stream will be billed as double the audio duration, even if both channels contain identical audio.
