Speaker diarization is the process of detecting multiple speakers in an audio, and understanding which parts of the transcription each speaker said.

## Configuration

### Activation

We offer two diarization models: the **default** version and the **enhanced** version. Despite its name, the enhanced version does not guarantee better results in all cases. However, it may perform better for specific use cases. We encourage you to try both versions.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Default">

Diarization is enabled by sending the `diarization` parameter in the transcription request.

```json
{
  "audio_url": "<your audio URL>",
  "diarization": true
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Enhanced">

Enhanced diarization is enabled in the `diarization_config` parameter.

```json
{
  "audio_url": "<your audio URL>",
  "diarization": true,
  "diarization_config" : {
    "enhanced": true
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Note>
Diarization has the following limitations:
* Default diarization is supported for audio files of up to 135 minutes. <br/>
* Enhanced diarization can handle longer audio files but does not support video files.
</Note>

### Improving diarization accuracy

You can improve the accuracy of diarization by providing hints about the expected number of speakers or specifying lower and upper bounds. **These parameters serve as hints, not strict constraints.** The actual number of speakers detected by the model may differ from the values provided.

API reference is available [here](https://docs.gladia.io/api-reference/v2/pre-recorded/init#body-diarization-config).

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `diarization_config.number_of_speakers` | number | Instruct the model to detect an exact number of speakers in the audio. |
| `diarization_config.min_speakers` | number | Instruct the model to detect no less than this number of speakers in the audio. |
| `diarization_config.max_speakers` | number | Instruct the model to detect no more than this number of speakers in the audio. |

<Note>
Enhanced diarization only supports the `number_of_speakers` parameter, which can be set to a value of either 1 or 2.
</Note>

## Results

When diarization is enabled, each utterance includes a `speaker` field, which contains an index representing the speaker. <br/>
Speakers are assigned indexes based on their order of appearance (e.g., the first speaker is speaker 0, the second is speaker 1, ...).

  "transcription": {
    "utterances": [
      {
        "words": [...],
