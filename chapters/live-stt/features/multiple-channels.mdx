If you have multiple channels in your audio stream, specify the count in the configuration:

```json
{
  "channels": 2
}
```

Gladia's real-time API will automatically split the channels and transcribe them separately.
For each utterance, you'll get a `channel` key corresponding to the channel the utterance came from.

<Warning>
  Transcribing an audio stream with multiple channels is billed per channel. For example, an audio stream with 2 channels will be billed as double the audio duration, even if the channels are identical.
</Warning>

<Note>
  For a detailed guide on how to merge multiple audio tracks into a single multi-channel stream and send it over a WebSocket, see the [Sending multiple audio tracks over a single WebSocket](/chapters/live-stt/quickstart#merging-multiple-audio-tracks-into-one-multi-channel-websocket) section.
