## Word-level timestamps

Instead of just getting timestamps for when utterances begin and end, Gladia's real-time API provides **word-level timestamps**. This lets you know the exact timestamp for each word,  giving you a more precise transcription, facilitating detailed analysis and more accurate synchronization with audio and video files.

To enable it, pass the following configuration:

```json
{
  "realtime_processing": {
    "words_accurate_timestamps": true
  }
}
```

Under each utterance, you'll find a `words` property, like this:

```json
{
  // ... other utterance properties
  "words": [
    {
      "word": "Split",
      "start": 0.21001999999999998,
      "end": 0.69015,
      "confidence": 1
    },
    {
      "word": " infinity",
      "start": 0.91021,
      "end": 1.55038,
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
  ]
}
```

## Custom vocabulary

To enhance the precision of words you know will recur often in your transcription, use the `custom_vocabulary` feature.<br />

```json
{
  "realtime_processing": {
    "custom_vocabulary": true,
    "custom_vocabulary_config": {
      "vocabulary": [
        "Westeros", 
        {"value": "Stark"}, 
        { 
          "value": "Night's Watch",
          "pronunciations": ["Nightz Watch"],
          "intensity": 0.4,
          "language": "en"
        }
      ],
      "default_intensity": 0.6
    }
  }
}
```

## Custom spelling
<CustomSpellingStartDescription />

```json request data
{
  "realtime_processing": {
    "custom_spelling": true,
    "custom_spelling_config": {
      "spelling_dictionary": {
          "Gorish": ["ghorish", "gaurish", "gaureish"],
          "Data Science": ["data-science", "data science"],
          ".": ["period", "full stop"],
          "SQL": ["sequel"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
<CustomSpellingEndDescription />

## Translation

This feature allows you to get both the original transcription and its translation in your specified target language(s) in real-time.

```json
{
  "realtime_processing": {
    "translation": true,
    "translation_config": {
      "target_languages": ["fr", "es"]  // Translate to French and Spanish
    }
  }
}
```

With this feature enabled, you'll receive a [`translation` message](/api-reference/v2/live/message/translation) for each [`transcript` message](/api-reference/v2/live/message/transcript) and target language.

## Multiple channels

If you have multiple channels in your audio stream, specify the count in the configuration:

```json
{
  "channels": 2
}
```

Gladia's real-time API will automatically split the channels and transcribe them separately.
For each utterance, you'll get a `channel` key corresponding to the channel the utterance came from.

<Warning>
  Transcribing an audio stream with multiple channels will be billed exponentially. For example, an audio stream with 2 channels will be billed as double the audio duration, even if the channels are identical.
</Warning>

<Note>
  For a detailed guide on how to merge multiple audio tracks into a single multi-channel stream and send it over a WebSocket, see the [Sending multiple audio tracks over a single WebSocket](/api-reference/live-flow#sending-multiple-audio-tracks-over-a-single-websocket) section.
</Note>

## Attaching custom metadata

You can attach metadata to your real-time transcription session using the `custom_metadata` property. This'll make it easy to recognize your transcription when you receive data from the [GET `/v2/live/:id` endpoint](/api-reference/v2/live/get). And more importantly, you'll be able to use it as a filter in the [GET `/v2/live` list endpoint](/api-reference/v2/live/list).
For example, you can add the following to your configuration:

```json
"custom_metadata": {
    "internalUserId": 2348739875894375,
    "paymentMethod": {
        "last4Digits": 4576
     },
     "internalUserName": "Spencer"
}
```

And use a GET request to filter results, like this:

```
https://api.gladia.io/v2/live?custom_metadata={"internalUserId": "2348739875894375"}
```

or like this:

```
https://api.gladia.io/v2/live?custom_metadata={"paymentMethod": {"last4Digits": 4576}, "internalUserName": "Spencer"}
```

<Warning>
  `custom_metadata` cannot be longer than 2000 characters when stringified.
</Warning>
