## IN PROGRESS bellow this part


<Note>All the configuration properties described below are defined in the [POST /v2/live endpoint](/api-reference/v2/live/init).</Note>


## Multiple channels

If you have multiple channels in your audio stream, specify the count in the configuration:

```json
{
  "channels": 2
}
```

Gladia's real-time API will automatically split the channels and transcribe them separately.
For each utterance, you'll get a `channel` key corresponding to the channel the utterance came from.

<Warning>
  Transcribing an audio stream with multiple channels will be billed exponentially. For example, an audio stream with 2 channels will be billed as double the audio duration, even if the channels are identical.
</Warning>
