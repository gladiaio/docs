<Note>All the configuration properties described below are defined in the [POST /v2/live endpoint](/api-reference/v2/live/init).</Note>

## Language detection

### Spoken language(s)

To obtain the best result (in terms of accuracy and speed), it's important to narrow the list of languages:

```json
{
  "language_config": {
    "languages": ["en"]
  }
}
```


### Code switching

If you expect multiple languages to be spoken during the real time session, enable the code switching option: 

```json
{
  "language_config": {
    "languages": ["en", "fr"],
    "code_switching": true
  }
}
```


## Word-level timestamps

Instead of just getting utterances start and end timestamps, **Gladia** Live Speech-To-Text API provides the
**Word-level timestamps** feature. It lets you know the exact timestamp for each word and give you a more precise transcription.
 This feature is particularly useful for detailed analysis, as it allows you to pinpoint the exact moment each word is spoken, facilitating
  a more accurate synchronization with audio or video files.

To enable it, pass the following configuration:  
```json
{
  "realtime_processing": {
    "words_accurate_timestamps": true
  }
}
```

Under each utterance, you'll find a `words` property like this:

```json
{
  // ... other utterance properties
  "words": [
    {
      "word": "Split",
      "start": 0.21001999999999998,
      "end": 0.69015,
      "confidence": 1
    },
    {
      "word": " infinity",
      "start": 0.91021,
      "end": 1.55038,
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
  ]
}
```


## Custom vocabulary

To enhance the precision of transcription, especially for words or phrases that recur often in your audio stream, you
 can utilize the `custom_vocabulary` feature in the configuration.<br/>
 The custom vocabulary has the following limitations:

 - global limit of **10k characters**
 - no more than **100 elements**
 - each element should not contain more than **5 words**

```json
{
  "realtime_processing": {
    "custom_vocabulary": true,
    "custom_vocabulary_config": {
      "vocabulary": ["Westeros", "Stark", "Night's Watch"]
    }
  }
}
```


## Multiple channels audio stream

If you have multiple channels in your audio stream, specify the count in the configuration:

```json
{
  "channels": 2
}
```

Gladia Live STT API will automatically split them and transcribe them separately.  
For each utterance, you will get a `channel` key corresponding to the channel the transcription came from.

<Warning>
Sending an audio with 2 channels will be billed twice the audio duration even if channels are identical.
</Warning>


## Attaching custom metadata

You can attach metadatas to your live transcription session using the `custom_metadata` property.
This will allow you to recognize your transcription when you get its data from the [GET `/v2/live/:id` endpoint](/api-reference/v2/live/get), but more important, it will allow you to use it as a filter in the [GET `/v2/live` list endpoint](/api-reference/v2/live/list).
For example, you can add the following to your configuration:

```json
"custom_metadata": {
    "internalUserId": 2348739875894375,
    "paymentMethod": {
        "last4Digits": 4576
     },
     "internalUserName": "Spencer"
}
```

And then, use the following GET request to filter results like:
```
https://api.gladia.io/v2/live?custom_metadata={"internalUserId": "2348739875894375"}
```
or
```
https://api.gladia.io/v2/live?custom_metadata={"paymentMethod": {"last4Digits": 4576}, "internalUserName": "Spencer"}
```

<Warning>

`custom_metadata` cannot be longer than 2000 characters when stringified.

</Warning>
