## IN PROGRESS bellow this part


<Note>All the configuration properties described below are defined in the [POST /v2/live endpoint](/api-reference/v2/live/init).</Note>



## Word-level timestamps

Instead of just getting timestamps for when utterances begin and end, Gladia's real-time API provides **word-level timestamps**. This lets you know the exact timestamp for each word,  giving you a more precise transcription, facilitating detailed analysis and more accurate synchronization with audio and video files.

To enable it, pass the following configuration:

```json
{
  "realtime_processing": {
    "words_accurate_timestamps": true
  }
}
```

Under each utterance, you'll find a `words` property, like this:

```json
{
  // ... other utterance properties
  "words": [
    {
      "word": "Split",
      "start": 0.21001999999999998,
      "end": 0.69015,
      "confidence": 1
    },
    {
      "word": " infinity",
      "start": 0.91021,
      "end": 1.55038,
      "confidence": 0.95
    },
  ]
}
```

## Custom vocabulary

To enhance the precision of words you know will recur often in your transcription, use the `custom_vocabulary` feature.<br />
Custom vocabulary has the following limitations:

* Global limit of **10k characters**
* No more than **100 entries**
* Each element can't contain more than **5 words**

```json
{
  "realtime_processing": {
    "custom_vocabulary": true,
    "custom_vocabulary_config": {
      "vocabulary": ["Westeros", "Stark", "Night's Watch"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Multiple channels

If you have multiple channels in your audio stream, specify the count in the configuration:

```json
{
  "channels": 2
}
```

Gladia's real-time API will automatically split the channels and transcribe them separately.
For each utterance, you'll get a `channel` key corresponding to the channel the utterance came from.

<Warning>
  Transcribing an audio stream with multiple channels will be billed exponentially. For example, an audio stream with 2 channels will be billed as double the audio duration, even if the channels are identical.
</Warning>

## Attaching custom metadata

You can attach metadata to your real-time transcription session using the `custom_metadata` property. This'll make it easy to recognize your transcription when you receive data from the [GET `/v2/live/:id` endpoint](/api-reference/v2/live/get). And more importantly, you'll be able to use it as a filter in the [GET `/v2/live` list endpoint](/api-reference/v2/live/list).
For example, you can add the following to your configuration:

```json
"custom_metadata": {
    "internalUserId": 2348739875894375,
    "paymentMethod": {
        "last4Digits": 4576
     },
     "internalUserName": "Spencer"
}
```

And use a GET request to filter results, like this:

```
https://api.gladia.io/v2/live?custom_metadata={"internalUserId": "2348739875894375"}
```

or like this:

```
https://api.gladia.io/v2/live?custom_metadata={"paymentMethod": {"last4Digits": 4576}, "internalUserName": "Spencer"}
```

<Warning>
  `custom_metadata` cannot be longer than 2000 characters when stringified.
