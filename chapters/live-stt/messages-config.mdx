## Messages you will send

### Sending data

To send audio content, use the `audio_chunk` message and encode your audio chunk in base64.

```json
{
  "type": "audio_chunk",
  "data": {
    "chunk": "<base64 encoded>"
  }
}
```

You will then receive an acknowledgment message, if configured (see bellow).

### Closing the session

The WebSocket automatically closes if no audio is received for 30 seconds. However, we recommend always closing your session manually once the live session is complete.

To do this, send the `stop_recording` message. This will trigger the processing of any remaining audio chunks and initiate the post-processing phase, during which we compile the final audio file and results, including the add-ons you selected.

```json
{
  "type": "stop_recording"
}
```

You will receive a message at each step of the process either through the WebSocket or via the callback if configured. Once the post-processing is complete, the WebSocket will close with code 1000.


## Messages you will receive

During real-time audio processing, various messages will be sent to provide data or update you on the systemâ€™s status. While you can choose to disable some of these messages, we recommend receiving all of them and filtering the ones that interest you on your end.
