Using [Gladia's playground](https://app.gladia.io/playground/1) is a convenient way to test our Speech To Text API. On the playground
you are able to transcribe remote audio files through URL, and also upload your local audio files, alongside with live
audio transcription.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your audio source">
    Choose your audio source (stream from you microphone, or upload a local file)

    </Frame>

    Then proceed to the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select features">
    You'll be able to select <Tooltip tip="If you want to see a complete list of the features Gladia's API provide check the Features section">some of
    the options</Tooltip> Gladia API provide for your transcription. \
    For this example, we want to detect the named entity (like email adresses, phone numbers, etc.), so we turned on **named entity recognition**.

    <Note>
      Only a few features of Gladia API are available on the playground. For more advanced testing,
      check [our API documentation](/api-reference/) instead.

      Text in italic in the transcription represents [partials transcripts](/chapters/live-stt/features#partial-transcripts).
