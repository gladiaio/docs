The SDK simplifies real-time speech-to-text integration by abstracting the underlying API. Designed for developers, it offers:
- Effortless implementation with minimal code to write.
- Built-in resilience with automatic error handling (e.g., reconnection on network drops) ensures uninterrupted transcription. No need to manually manage retries or state recovery.
