## Language configuration

### Single language

If you know the language of the conversation in advance, specify it in the `language_config.languages` parameter to ensure the best transcription results.

```json
{
  ...rest of the config
  "language_config": {
    "languages": ["en"]
  }
}
```

If the spoken language is unknown, you can:

- Omit the `language_config.languages` parameter; the model will automatically detect the language from the first few seconds of audio **across all supported languages**.
- Specify multiple languages in the `language_config.languages` parameter; the model will detect the language from the first few seconds of audio **within the provided options**.

<CodeGroup>

```json Limited options
{
  ...rest of the config
  // Will limit to detect from English, French or Spanish
  "language_config": {
    "languages": ["en", "fr", "es"]
  }
}
```

```json All languages
{
  ...rest of the config
  // You can omit the parameter
  "language_config": {
    "languages": []
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Multiple languages <br/>(Code-switching)

If you expect multiple languages to be spoken during the conversation, enable the `language_config.code_switching` parameter. This will allow the model to switch languages dynamically and reflect it in the transcription results.

As with single-language configuration, you can either let the model detect the language from **all supported languages** or specify a **set of options** to narrow down the selection.

<CodeGroup>

```json Limited options
{
  ...rest of the config
  "language_config": {
    // Will limit to detect from English, French or Spanish
    "languages": ["en", "fr", "es"],
    "code_switching": true
  }
}
```

```json All languages
{
  ...rest of the config
  "language_config": {
    // You can omit the languages parameter
    "languages": [],
    "code_switching": true
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Tip>
  It is recommended to limit the number of languages to avoid incorrect
  detection, either in single or multiple languages configuration. Some
  languages, such as those from Eastern European countries, have similar sounds,
  which may cause the model to confuse them and produce a transcription in the
  wrong language.
