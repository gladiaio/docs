You can get your transcription results in **3 different ways**: 

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="repeat" title="Polling">

  Once you post your transcription request, you get a transcription `id` and a pre-built `result_url` for convenience.
  To get the result with this method, you'll just have to GET continuously on the given `result_url` until the status
  of your transcription is `done`.


  You can get more information on the different transcriptions status by checking directly the [API Reference](/api-reference/).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="webhook" title="Webhook">
  You can configure webhooks at https://app.gladia.io/account to be notified when your transcriptions are done.
  <img src='/assets/images/webhooks-1.png'/>
  Once a transcription is done, a `POST` request will be made to the endpoint you configured. The request body is a JSON object containing the transcription `id` that you can use to retrieve your result with [our API](/api-reference/api-v2/Transcription/get-v2transcription).  
  For the full body definition, check [our API definition](/api-reference/api-v2/Webhooks/transcription-success).  
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="diagram-project" title="Callback URL">

  Callback are HTTP calls that you can use to get notified when your transcripts are ready.

  Instead of polling and keeping your server busy and maintaining work, you can use the `callback_url` feature.
  By providing a `callback_url` on your transcription request body payload, we will send the results right there once 
  your transcription is done.

  ```json
  {
    "audio_url": "YOUR_AUDIO_URL",
    "callback_url": "https://yourserverurl.com/your/callback/endpoint/"
  }
  ```

  Once the transcription is done, a `POST` request will be made to the `callback_url` you provided.  
  The request body is a JSON object containing the transcription `id` and an `event` property that tells you if it's a [success](/api-reference/api-v2/Callback/transcription-success) or an [error](/api-reference/api-v2/Callback/transcription-error).
