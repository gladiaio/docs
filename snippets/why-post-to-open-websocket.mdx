<Accordion title="Why initiate with POST instead of connecting directly to the WebSocket?">
- **Security**: Generate the WebSocket URL on your backend and keep your API key private. The init call returns a connectable URL and a session `id` that you can safely pass to web, iOS, or Android clients without exposing credentials in the app.
- **Lower infrastructure load**: The secure URL is generated on your backend, the client can connect directly to Gladia's WebSocket server without a pass-through on your side, saving your own resources.
- **Resilient reconnection and session continuity**: If the WebSocket disconnects (which can happen on unreliable networks), the session created by the init call lets the client reconnect without losing context. Traditional flows that open a socket first typically force a brand‑new session on disconnect, dropping in‑progress state.
