You can customize how certain words, names or phrases are spelled in the final transcript.
<br/>To use custom spelling, provide a dictionary through the `custom_spelling_config` parameter. This dictionary should contain the correct spelling as the key and a list of one or more possible variations as the value.

Custom spelling is useful in scenarios where consistent spelling of specific words is crucial (e.g., technical terms in industry-specific recordings).

<Note>
The keys in the dictionary are case sensitive, while the values aren't. Values can contain multiple words.
